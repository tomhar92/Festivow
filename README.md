# Festivow
A skeleton for a website for music concerts and festivals.
I wanted to create a social guide for music concerts and festivals. I have used VueJS for the client side and NodeJS for server side with Firebase and mongoDB.

I have dropped the project right when I was moving from Firebase to mongoDB. Since connection to DB had been deprecated, some of the features won't work.
